# Hobby projects

In this repo, I specify hobby projects that you can do in your spare time for practicing programming. Also some of these projects might come in handy either for you or for someone else. 

I highly encourage you to work together with peers and open source your work so that others can see, comment and improve upon your work. This is great knowledge sharing and will benefit everyone. 

Create separate repos for each project so that it's easier to share with each other.
